# Stock_Price_Prediction
Using RNN (LSTM) techniques to try to predict stock returns

This project tries to predict stock price returns using Long Short-Term Memory neural networks.  Throughout this notebook you can find data exploration, data cleaning, baseline models, data transformations, feature engineering, and dimension reduction.

The model was developed via Google Collab using their GPU resources.
